# Special:UserScore

The SpecialUserScore extension for [MediaWiki](http://www.mediawiki.org) measures user scores by the number of contributions.

See the [MediaWiki.org extension page](http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:SpecialUserScore) for details.

# Installation

Create a new directory `extensions/SpecialUserScore/`, and copy all of these files into it.

Add the following line to the end of LocalSettings.php:

    wfLoadExtension( 'SpecialUserScore' );
